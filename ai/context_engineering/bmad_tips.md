1. ask your agent to read the @data/kb to know the bmad workflow to 
guide you out when stuck in a workflow

2. sometimes the agents don't doc-out you need to check it or else you'll have a nice convo and clear the context. hahahahah

3. Major: store in the memory of AGENTS.md to use `read-modify-write` strategy or else it'll just overwrite and
by chance you are gitignoring it then, tata bye bye

4. commit the .bmad directory if you wanna work in jules to delegate some implementations

5. Maintain an archived sprints directory to keep track of the previous sprints and their context.
