    "## üß† Evaluation Criteria for System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplicity**  \n",
    "   - Easy to understand and maintain.\n",
    "   - Avoid overengineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fidelity**  \n",
    "   - Accuracy and faithfulness to business logic.\n",
    "   - Ensures expected outcomes under real-world usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cost Effectiveness**  \n",
    "   - Evaluate ROI.\n",
    "   - Choose solutions that provide optimal balance between performance and cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üì¶ Example: E-Commerce T-Shirt Company\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Existing Sources** *(Don't Repeat Yourself ‚Äì DRY)*:\n",
    "  - Sell via platforms like Amazon, Myntra.\n",
    "  - Use Shopify for hosted store solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Technical Wrappers**:\n",
    "  - Create API contracts to integrate and manage external sources efficiently.\n",

    "## üöÄ Deployment Server Options\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Local Machine (On-Premise)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Low cost  \n",
    "- ‚ùå Low simplicity  \n",
    "- ‚ùå Manual scaling, maintenance overhead  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Cloud Server (IaaS)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Cost-effective for scale  \n",
    "- ‚úÖ More choices, greater customization  \n",
    "- ‚ùå Manual deployment  \n",
    "- ‚ùå Manual recovery in case of crash  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Serverless (e.g. AWS Lambda, Vercel, Cloudflare Workers)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ No manual deployment (CI/CD from GitHub)  \n",
    "- ‚úÖ Automatic scaling  \n",
    "- ‚úÖ High abstraction and simplicity  \n",
    "- ‚ùå Higher cost  \n",

    "## üóÇÔ∏è Storing Static Content\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Content Delivery Network (CDN)\n",
    "- Geographically distributed edge servers  \n",
    "- Used for caching:\n",
    "  - Images, videos, files, static HTML pages  \n",
    "- Examples: **Akamai, CloudFront**  \n",
    "- Consistency is a challenge (eventual consistency)\n",
    "- CDN watches a folder for updates and spreads the changes to it's edege servers.\n",
    "- Commonly backed by:\n",
    "  - AWS S3\n",
    "  - Azure Blob Storage\n",
    "  - Hadoop FS\n",
    "  - Ceph  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Server or Serverless Hosting\n",
    "- Better suited for dynamic content  \n",
    "- Scaling is complex and configuration-intensive  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üåê Domain Name System (DNS)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maps domain name to server IPs  \n",
    "- Process flow:\n",
    "    - Browser ‚ûù Router ‚ûù ISP ‚ûù DNS ‚ûù IP (CDN/server) ‚ûù Webpage Response\n",
    "- DNS caching in browsers improves performance  \n",
    "- Useful when redirecting domains (e.g., Shopify domain to custom domain)\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üêû Debugging & Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Logging and Monitoring\n",
    "- Use **CloudWatch**, custom logs with regex parsing  \n",
    "- Centralized error collection and alerting  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Observability and Anomaly Detection\n",
    "- Real-time dashboards:\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Redundancy\n",
    "- Identify critical paths and dependencies  \n",
    "- Redundant systems minimize downtime  \n",
    "- Be cautious with external services; they may fail  \n",
    "- Higher cost and complexity, but increased reliability  \n",
    "- Cloud platforms offer built-in redundancy  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Graceful Degradation\n",
    "- Predefined error messages  \n",
    "- Inform users of partial failures without crashing  \n",
