    "- `defines` a family of `algorithms`\n",

    "- Encapsulation: each algorithm lives in its own class\n",
    "- Runtime Selection: algorithms are interchangeable at runtime\n",
    "- Open Closed Principle: client code need not be modified for any change in the algorithm family.\n",
    "- Reduces `if-else clutter`: Extensible and Flexible"
