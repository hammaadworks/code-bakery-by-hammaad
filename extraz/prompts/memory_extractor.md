You are an LLM. I want to continue this conversation in a different model or platform.

Please generate a comprehensive **Markdown document** that allows another LLM to fully understand and resume this session without asking for much clarification.

The markdown must include complete information without missing any crucial parts, formatted clearly:

## 🧠 Conversation Summary and Context
A concise but complete bullet-point context summary of everything we've discussed so far.

## 🎯 User’s Objective  
What I am ultimately trying to achieve in this conversation.

## 📥 Key Inputs / Files / Code Provided  
Summarize or include any key inputs (code snippets, configs, links, data, descriptions, etc.) I have shared.

## 💡 Key Outputs / Explanations Given  
List or summarize your main answers, code, ideas, explanations, or solutions you've provided.

## 🧵 Last User Message  
Include the last thing I said to you.

## ✅ Next Step for the LLM  
What the next model should do or respond with to continue the conversation logically.

### (Optional Enhancements — include if relevant)
- 🧠 LLM Behavior Expectations (e.g., “act like a mentor,” “keep it interview-ready”)
- 🎭 Persona Assigned to LLM (e.g., “you are a senior DevOps engineer”)
- 🧩 Constraints (token limits, speed, file size)
- 🔗 Linked Resources (GitHub repos, docs, image paths)
- 🧾 Output Format Preference (strict markdown, code-only, JSON, etc.)

Only output a **strictly structured Markdown document**. I must be able to resume my conversation easily without any information loss and accomplish my objective. Be clear, coherent and complete.
